# 🔐 Azure Identity and Access Management (IAM) Role Simulation

This hands-on project demonstrates the implementation of Identity and Access Management (IAM) using Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory). I created users and groups, assigned RBAC roles like Reader and Contributor, and tested secure access to Azure resources.

## 📌 Why IAM Matters
IAM is critical in real-world organizations to enforce least-privilege access, reduce insider threats, and ensure only authorized users access specific cloud resources. This project mirrors best practices in secure cloud operations.
